🧩 Reusable Redux Architecture (Action · Reducer · Saga Factories)
This project follows a factory-based Redux + Redux-Saga architecture to reduce boilerplate and enforce consistency when handling API-driven state.
The setup is built around three core utilities:
Action Types Factory
Reducer Factory
Saga Factory
Together, they provide a scalable and maintainable pattern for managing async API flows.

# 🧩 Reusable Redux Architecture (Action · Reducer · Saga Factories)

This project follows a **factory-based Redux + Redux-Saga architecture** to reduce boilerplate and enforce consistency when handling API-driven state.

The setup is built around **three core utilities**:

1. Action Types Factory  
2. Reducer Factory  
3. Saga Factory  

Together, they provide a scalable and maintainable pattern for managing async API flows.
